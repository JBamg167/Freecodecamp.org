    <p>Your Name – <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-b-a267151a4" target="_blank"> Joseph Baker</a> </p>

    <p>Your Bio – Need advice here as not sure what to write</p>

    <p> Your 3 episodes from school, jobs, side projects, etc where you’ve faced an issue/challenge, how you overcame them and what
    happened afterwards- </p>
</div>   
 <ol>
    <li>Gaining trust with suppliers – Initially we overcame this buy paying pro-forma, after a period of paying upfront we paid on time, to ensure a good long term working partnership. This proved to be of benefit numerous times when materials were scarce, having called on relationships built overtime to secure what we needed.</li>
        <li>Securing skilled resource – Having worked on the tools prior to starting, I approached the teams I felt were worth working with, most declined due to the uncertainty of the start-up. To overcome this, I offered them above market price and consistent work, guaranteed weekly pay, and the freedom to enjoy time off once the weekly targets had been met, or earn extra if they chose to work. This provided the workers the ability to be flexible and created a great environment for people to feel rewarded for working hard.</li></ul>
        
        <li>Transitioning from sub to principal contractor - challenges and how I overcame them:
        
    Compliance – We needed to build the team and put processes together to remain compliant with not only the client, but the local authority and the law. We hired an experienced SHEQ manager, gave him a brief of what we were intending on achieving and what we thought was required to achieve it. He gained and retained us various ISO’s by implementing correct procedure throughout the business. This then created a springboard for us to approach further clients as a principal contractor.</li>
            
 </ol>

    <p>Your Education and/or Professional Experiences –</p>
    <p>No formal school qualifications, left school at 13 as part of an initiative to send disruptive children to college after exhausting other avenues of behavioural management. Since then, I have personally paid to put myself through all of my qualifications to climb the pay/experience ladder.</p>

<p>Your Recent Projects-</p>
<p>I am currently working on bringing to life an idea I had whilst working constructing utility networks. Working with industry experts, tech and design partners we are close to testing the prototype. We are hoping this revolutionises the way the industry performs the tasks we are automating and really benefits for the efficiencies it drives, saving time and money allowing the client to be more productive with the increasingly scarce resource.</p>
